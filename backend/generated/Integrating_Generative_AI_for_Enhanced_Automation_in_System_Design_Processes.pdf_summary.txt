This work delves into the potential of applying Generative AI techniques to the system design phase. Gen AI is used to automate the creation of complex design elements and is emerging as a powerful tool for system engineers. This paper introduces methods for system design using Gen AI to generate design information. The system design phase is pivotal in determining a system’s functionality, performance, and overall success. LLMs can analyze vast amounts of data, extract patterns, and generate complex outputs that aid decision- making and problem-solving. By leveraging these powers, LLMs enable engineers to streamline design tasks. The SE Assistant is a tool for automating the creation of DesDocs. It leverages Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (M-RAG) to enhance the capabilities of GPT-4 for system design-specific generation. The SE Assistant operates on a multi-step process to generate Des Docs using the M-RAG architecture. The SE Assistant ingests system requirements and constraints. It formulates prompts that encapsulate these requirements. Prompts are processed through an embedding model and a vector database. Vectors retrieve relevant context from the database, informing the generated DesDoc. The output is a comprehensive DesDoc proposing solutions and architectures. This method intertwines generative and evaluative pro- cesses, leveraging the strengths of both AI and human in- telligence for a more reliable, innovative, and feasible system design. In the procedural flow, LLMs provide initial evalua- tions, and a system engineer’s insights ensure robust, nuanced evaluation. In conclusion, Gen AI can improves the efficiency and accuracy of system design documentation in complex systems. It can also provide a valuable tool for system engineers.
